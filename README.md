In modern development and documentation, creating diagrams directly from code has become a powerful tool for visualizing complex ideas. [Mermaid.js](https://mermaid.js.org/) enables users to generate flowcharts, sequence diagrams, Gantt charts, and more, using simple text-based syntax. It integrates seamlessly with Markdown and various platforms like GitHub and GitLab, making it an ideal choice for technical documentation. By treating visualizations as code, Mermaid.js streamlines the process, allowing diagrams to be easily maintained and updated. This approach enhances both clarity and efficiency in visual communication.
