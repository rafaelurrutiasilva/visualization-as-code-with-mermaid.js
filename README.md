In modern development and documentation, creating diagrams directly from code has become a powerful tool for visualizing complex ideas. [Mermaid.js](https://mermaid.js.org/) enables users to generate flowcharts, sequence diagrams, Gantt charts, and more, using simple text-based syntax. It integrates seamlessly with Markdown and various platforms like GitHub and GitLab, making it an ideal choice for technical documentation. By treating visualizations as code, Mermaid.js streamlines the process, allowing diagrams to be easily maintained and updated. This approach enhances both clarity and efficiency in visual communication.

## Goals
A concise introduction to Mermaid.js through a practical application and document it for my own reference.
Here is PowerCLI used to interact with a vCenter instance to retrieve its vSphere datacenters, underlying clusters, and the ESXi hosts within them. This data is then visualized in a dynamic diagram using Mermaid.js, offering a clear and organized view of the infrastructure.

## Conclusion
By combining automation from your preferred programming language with Mermaid.js visualizations, you can efficiently represent complex environments in a simple and maintainable format.
